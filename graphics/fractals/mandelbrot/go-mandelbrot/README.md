# go-mandelbrot

A [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) visualizer, written in Go.

I'd never messed around with fractals much, and since the Mandelbrot set is the most iconic fractal there is (plus, the implementation is dead simple), I decided to start with it. On the way, I learned a lot about Affine transforms, which are just nifty.
